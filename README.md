# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Set up environment variables

   Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your Appwrite credentials:
   
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Then edit `.env` and add:
   - `EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT` - Your Appwrite endpoint (e.g., `https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1`)
   - `EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID` - Your Appwrite project ID
   - `APPWRITE_API_KEY` - Your Appwrite admin API key (for database setup)
   - `APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID` - Optional, defaults to `grovi-db`

3. Set up the database

   Run the database setup script to create collections, attributes, and permissions:
   
   ```bash
   npm run setup-database
   ```

4. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

## MVP analytics

The database setup also creates the `analytics_events` collection used by the fail-safe client analytics layer. It requires no environment variables beyond the existing Appwrite values. Run `npm run test:analytics` to test the event helpers. See [docs/ANALYTICS_MVP.md](docs/ANALYTICS_MVP.md) for collection permissions, indexes, supported events, privacy boundaries, and MVP limitations.

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
